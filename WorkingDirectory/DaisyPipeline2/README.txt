4. Prerequisites                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modules already include their dependent libraries and only require a recent
Java environment (Java SE 7 or later).

To get the latest version of Java, go to http://www.java.com/

The "bin" directory of the Java Runtime Environment installation must be on 
the system PATH. Refer to the documentation for more details on how to 
configure this on your operating system.

On Mac and Linux, the command line tool requires a Ruby runtime environment
(version 1.8 or above). A Ruby runtime is already bundled in the executable on
Windows.


5. Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Command line tool ###

 1. get the short help by running the launcher script 'dp2' on
 Mac/Linux or 'dp2.exe' on Windows from the "cli" directory
 2. run 'dp2 help a-script-name' to get the detailed description of a script
 4. execute a job with the 'dp2 a-script-name' subcommand and specify the
 required options (as given with the 'dp2 help a-script-name' command)

For instance:

	> cli\dp2.exe dtbook-to-zedai --i-source samples\dtbook\hauy_valid.xml
	--x-output-dir "C:\Users\John Doe\Desktop\out"


will run the DTBook to ZedAI converter on Windows and will output the result 
in the "out" directory on the desktop of the user named "John Doe".


### RESTful Web Service ###

 1. start the web service by running 'bin/pipeline' on Mac/Linux or
 'bin\pipeline.bat' on Windows
 2. the web service is available on http://localhost:8181/ws/
 3. For example, get the list of scripts by issuing a GET request on
 http://localhost:8181/ws/scripts
